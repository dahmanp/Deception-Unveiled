    If you want answers to spooky questions, I would check places that have long

  - "Sorry you came to visit at such a dark time in our town\u2019s history\u2026
    maybe I can help with the investigation! If you want to know about the nature
    of strange creatures, check places filled with shadows and nature. Good luck!"
  - "Don\u2019t tell anyone I said this, but at the far ends of the town\u2019s border
    there is rumored to be a creepy building. No one knows what it was used for.
    Maybe it will help you solve the mystery."
  - "If you want to get closer to completing your investigation, there is a forest
    nearby that seems to\u2026talk to you. It gives me the creeps, but the townspeople
    claim the forest will lead you to your fate."
  - "You want help with the investigation? I\u2019ve been hearing strange sounds
    nearby - something like rattling bones and moving stones. Hope you find something!"

  wins:
  - The ruins are covered in plant life, though you can see that this was once a
    place of bustling life. As you tread deeper into the crumbling buildings, you
    notice strange symbols and tapestries. These murals depict a group of sorcerers
    surrounding a monstrous creature, attacking with all their might. What does this
    mean?
  - As you listen to the sounds of the forest, you pick up on an unusual sound; it
    almost sounds like crying. Perhaps this clue will help determine the goals of
    the monsters?
  - As you walk through the underground halls, you notice that the walls are streaked
    with claw marks and blood. Papers are lying around unorganized, some even caught
    in the wall damage. When you get to the end of the hall, you find yourself standing
    before an open room with glass littering the ground. What happened here?
  - "The wind rustling the trees almost sounds like whistling\u2026 or whispers.
    The trees seem to be leading you to the edge of the town grounds, into a secluded
    area. As you get closer to the border, you start to see a secluded building.
    What could that be?"
  - 'The graveyard emits an aura of melancholy as you walk through it. You take notice
    of the gravestones, each with a name, birth date, and death date. As you near
    the back of the graveyard, you notice something off about one of the headstones:
    there is no birth date on it. The stone reads: Jordan Hatcher: Doctor, Husband,
    Friend. Interesting.'
  hints:
  - "Check out the crumbling remains of a lost civilization; they\u2019re full of
    secrets."
  - 'Wander through the thick woods where sunlight struggles to shine; it feels mysterious. '
  - "Look for the hidden space beneath the town filled with strange devices; it\u2019s
    intriguing. "
  - "Walk in the forest where the wind makes the trees whistle; it\u2019s refreshing
    and lively."
  - Explore the misty resting place filled with mossy stones; it has an eerie atmosphere.
