  intro_quests:
  - "I\u2019m sorry you arrived here when the mood is so gloomy. Maybe we can do
    something to brighten the mood? Ask someone in town if there is something that
    would cheer them up."
  - Have you found out how many total people have gone missing? I need to update
    the town records, and that information would be really helpful.
  - Hey there, travelers! Can you ask someone if they know what times to avoid being
    outside? I want to make sure I get all my yard work done before the monsters
    come out.
  - Hello detectives, can you get some information from a person around the town?
    I would like to know the best way to protect my house from the monsters.
  - "I need to know what the best food to stock up on is. I\u2019m planning on hiding
    out in my house until the monsters die."
  intros:
  - Good evening, what can I do for you?
  - Hi. Did you need something?
  - Howdy, what seems to be the problem?
  - Hiya, what can I do for you?
  - Hello there, how may I be of service to you?
  fails:
  - Go away.
  - Leave me alone, weirdo.
  - "I really don\u2019t want to talk to you anymore. Good day."
  - "I don\u2019t think that\u2019s any of your business. Leave me alone."
  - "Um, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m busy, so please let me get back to work."
  win1s:
  - "Oh, how thoughtful! Let\u2019s see\u2026 a town gathering may help - everyone
    used to get together a lot before the monsters started taking folks."
  - "Oh, um, yeah, it\u2019s been the talk of the town. So many of my friends are
    gone and I\u2019m worried that I\u2019m next\u2026"
  - "Hmm\u2026 it\u2019s a little tricky, but they tend to be more active during
    the hours of the night. At least, if what I hear is correct."
  - I have been boarding up my windows and giving my family secret codes to ensure
    that they are who they say they are. I hear the monster can mimic your family
    and friends. Is there anything else you want to know?
  - I would say that your best bet is to get non-perishable canned food. It will
    last longer and be safer to eat.
  win2s:
  - "I think, in addition to the gathering, a potluck may be a good idea. Everyone
    has their own specialties to share, and it\u2019s wonderful to eat together."
  - "I would say about five, but keep in mind our town\u2019s population is only
    about 30."
  - I would steer clear of the forests at night, and any area not so well lit. Hope
    I was a little bit helpful during your investigation!
  - Not yet, though I have been hearing whispers in the night, and strange growling
    and crackling. Hope this was helpful.
  - There are plenty of high quality storage tanks at the general store, I would
    look there! Hope you find what you need!
