  - Hello! Welcome to Whispering Pines! Not many of us live here, but the folks that
    do really enjoy fancy jewelry. Can you help me find a piece for my next necklace
    line?
  - Hey there! Welcome to our town! Are you looking for something interesting? If
    you help me find my lost book, I can give you some interesting facts.
  - "Please detective, I need your help. My beloved daughter has gone missing, and
    I can\u2019t find her anywhere! I\u2019ve searched the entire town but I have
    found no trace of her. Please, find me anything that could tell me where she
    is."
  - "Have you heard the rumors? People tend to talk a whole lot when there are mysterious
    things happening. I have my own secrets, and I can tell you them if you give
    me the town\u2019s talk."
  - "I\u2019ve been really unsettled lately. I\u2019ve been hearing strange sounds
    when I\u2019m trying to sleep. Strange whispers. Can you find out what they\u2019re
    saying?"
  - Good evening. If you have a moment, I would like you to find something for me.
    It may help you in your investigation. I'm sure you have heard by now of monstrous
    creatures that take the forms of friends and family, roaming the forests and
    stalking our town of Whispering Pines. Bring back a clue that can help with tracking
    them down and I will tell you something that may be valuable to you.
  - I heard rattling metal the other day. It was awful. I can still hear it sometimes.
    Please find the awful source so I can destroy it.
  - "Hello, dear detective! Can you help me find something? I\u2019m looking for
    something cool to use as a tattoo design. I know you\u2019re busy, but this is
    very important to me."
  - "My poor dog is starving, can you help me find something to feed him? He\u2019s
    the one that keeps guard over my home and keeps my family safe."
  - Have you heard of the doctor that died recently? I wonder if his notes are still
    around the town. Can you find them for me? I can help you decipher them.
  fails:
  - "Umm. This isn\u2019t what I was looking for. Don\u2019t talk to me if you can\u2019t
    complete a simple task."
  - "I don\u2019t think this is right\u2026 Maybe I can\u2019t help you after all.
    Sorry."
  - This did not belong to her. She must be out there somewhere, I know it! I will
    go find someone who can actually track her down.
  - "That doesn\u2019t make sense. I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t help you anymore."
  - "I\u2019m not sure this is what I heard. Thanks for trying, though. "
  - "This is not what I asked for. You aren\u2019t as good of a detective team as
    I thought you would be - I\u2019ll keep my information for a real professional."
  - "This doesn\u2019t seem right. I don\u2019t think this could make that sound."
  - "Ehhh I don\u2019t think this works. Sorry for the trouble, but you best be on
    your way."
  - "I don\u2019t think dogs can eat that. Never mind, I\u2019ll find something myself."
  - Do these look like notes to you? Are you stupid?
  wins:
  - Thank you so much! I hear this gemstone has paranormal properties, but I just
    want to make it into a necklace!
  - "This is my book, thank you! I found it in the woods nearby, and have been fascinated
    with the contents. Did you know that the forests around Whispering Pines have
    magical properties? It\u2019s pretty interesting, though a bit scary at times."
  - "Oh no\u2026 this was a piece of her dress\u2026 Thank you for bringing this
    to me. I think she was led away by one of those foul monsters, and I\u2019m afraid
    she must not have made it. Take care, detectives, I\u2019m going to return home
    to mourn."
  - "Ah, thank you! Here\u2019s my secret: I saw a vile creature snatch a young girl
    the other night - I never liked her parents so I said nothing. Have fun with
    the rest of your investigation!"
  - "This sounds exactly like the voices in the night! I hear them every night at
    around 9pm\u2026 I hope you catch whatever person is doing it."
  - "Ah, this is just what I\u2019ve been looking for! These footprints appear to
    be fairly humanoid in shape, but fluctuate in size and density. What do you make
    of this?"
  - "Oh, that wretched thing. I\u2019m going to melt it down and turn it into something
    useful. Though, it\u2019s strange that there\u2019s a random broken chain in
    the forest. I wonder where it came from."
  - "Perfect! These remind me of those symbols my family used to use to keep monsters
    at bay. Those are just legends though, so I wouldn\u2019t worry too much."
  - "Oh he will love this! Thank you so much! It\u2019s funny, these bones almost
    look human. Thank you again for your help, and good luck with the investigation!"
  - "Ah yes, exactly what I was looking for. That\u2019s strange, I can hardly read
    them. Do you see that they\u2019re encoded? He must\u2019ve really wanted them
    kept secret."
  hints:
  - "There\u2019s a stunning gem that catches the light; its brilliance hints at
    deeper mysteries waiting to be uncovered."
  - "There\u2019s talk of a dusty tome filled with forbidden knowledge; its pages
    are said to pulse with echoes of lost magic."
  - Be on the lookout for torn fabric; it may reveal marks of desperate encounters
    and battles fought in the dark
  - You might want to talk to the elders; their stories often weave together history
    and legend, revealing hidden clues.
  - At night, listen closely for soft sounds that drift through the darkness; they
    could carry hidden secrets.
  - Keep an eye out for strange tracks that twist in unexpected ways; they might
    hint at something otherworldly nearby.
  - Rumor has it that silent remains lie somewhere, bearing witness to lives lived
    and lost in the shadows.
  - Look for ancient carvings; their intricate patterns are said to whisper secrets
    of forgotten rituals.
  - Rumor has it that silent remains lie somewhere, bearing witness to lives lived
    and lost in the shadows.
  - They say there are fragmented thoughts somewhere, revealing unsettling insights
    about a mind unravelling.
